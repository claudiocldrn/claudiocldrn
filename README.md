# About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on teaching myself the principles of DevOps, but also coding by coding a text based Genshin Wish Simulator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Python (hiss hiss and whatnot), as well as the principles of the CI/CD pipeline
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DevOps principles. I'd love to have a chat about it
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn look up Claudio Calderon. same profile picture as here.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making things, and have taught myself how to 3D model (as far as my laptop with the graphics card that has the processing power of an eraser shaving will allow,) and also how to use and trouble shoot and Ender 3 pro. I've also taught myself how to make rings, and have made makeshift mandrels for ring making.
